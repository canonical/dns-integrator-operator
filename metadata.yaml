description: |
  A [Juju](https://juju.is/) [charm](https://juju.is/docs/olm/charmed-operators)
  deploying and managing a DNS Integrator on Kubernetes and bare metal.
  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and distributed name service
  that provides a naming system for computers, services, and other resources on
  the Internet or other Internet Protocol (IP) networks

  This charm simplifies configuration of DNS by providing a simple way to express
  DNS record request to a compatible DNS operator provider. It can be
  deployed on many different Kubernetes platforms, from [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io)
  to [Charmed Kubernetes](https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes) and public cloud Kubernetes
  offerings but also on virtual machines or bare metal.
